# DynoGP

This repository presents a novel approach to system identification for dynamical systems using a specialised class of Deep Gaussian Processes. Our method combines linear dynamic GPs (representing stochastic Linear Time Invariant systems) with static GPs to model nonlinearities. This approach not only captures system dynamics but also quantifies uncertainty.
